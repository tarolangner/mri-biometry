**biometry_results**
The directory *biometry_results* contains plots and aggregated saliency maps for 64 labels inferred by the generalized biometry framework in 7-fold cross-validation [1].

The file *uncertainty_aware_bodycomp.pdf* contains extended supplementary material for the uncertainty-aware ensembling technique [2].
